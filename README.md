# Enigma

## Functionality
- 3 for functionality. The `enigma` class decrypts and encrypts successfully and the CLI is successfully implemented. The cracking method wasn't even attempted.

## OOP
- 3.5 for OOP. I actually started with a 300+ line `enigma` class, and then refactored that out to create a `cipher` class, and then `decrypter` and `encrypter` classes that are associated with a `cryptable` module. I left it at a 3.5 because looking back at it I can see how potentially `decrypter` and `encrypter` could have been modules instead of classes. At the same time, for the purposes of this project I think that they function fine as classes. It'll be interesting to see what feedback the instructor has.

## Ruby Convention and Mechanics
- I'd say another 3.5 for Ruby Convention and Mechanics. I used appropriate enumerables where applicable and I can explain exactly what each piece accomplishes. I'll have to check but I may have one or two methods that are over 10 lines, which is why I wouldn't give myself a 4 here based on the rubric. I looked at those methods a few ways and I'm comfortable with them being long, I don't see a way to refactor them given the set up of my project.

## TDD
- 3 for TDD. All my tests are at 100% coverage but I did not do any mocks or stubs.

## Version Control
- My version control would be a pass - I have well over 30 commits along with several branches.
